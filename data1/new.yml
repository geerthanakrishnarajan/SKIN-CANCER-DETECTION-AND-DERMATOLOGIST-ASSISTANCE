  - Hello! your name has been stored. What is your skin cancer type?
- - Basal cell carcinoma
  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that forms in the basal cells of your skin. Basal cells exist in the lower part of your epidermis, which is the outside layer of your skin. Basal cell carcinoma looks like a small, sometimes shiny bump or scaly flat patch on your skin that slowly grows over time.
- - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
  - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer originating in T-lymphocytes, primarily affects the skin and lymph tissue. Commonly known as lymphoma of the skin, it manifests as scaly lesions or tumors. Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome are its two main types. As a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it progresses gradually over several years.
- - Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
  - Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare skin cancer originating in the dermal connective tissue cells. Initially resembling a pimple or rough skin patch, it progresses with the formation of tissue lumps on the arms, legs, and trunk. Characterized by slow growth, DFSP rarely metastasizes beyond the skin.
- - Kaposi sarcoma
  - Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which cancer cells are found in the skin or mucous membranes that line the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from mouth to anus, including the stomach and intestines. These tumors appear as purple patches or nodules on the skin and/or mucous membranes and can spread to lymph nodes and lungs.
- - Merkel cell carcinoma
  - Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer that can be life-threatening. The cancer affects your skin's outer layer, or epidermis. It often spreads to lymph nodes and organs. UV light exposure, a weak immune system, age and viral infection may cause this cancer.
- - Sebaceous carcinoma
  - Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that starts in your skin's oil-producing (sebaceous) glands. It's an aggressive cancer that can return after treatment. A pimple-like bump on your upper eyelid is a common symptom, but tumors can form anywhere.
- - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer caused by an overproduction of squamous cells in your epidermis, the top layer of your skin. Exposing your skin to the sun’s UV rays puts you at a high risk of getting skin cancer. Treatment to remove cancer leads to a positive prognosis if the cancer is found and treated early
